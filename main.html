<h3>About</h3>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Brain Insane Mad Libs! This website is used to have the user answer questions and then to potentially select a category to fill with their answers.
    We hope that you will have a fun time and some good laughs from answering the questions, and the outcomes of the category you filled out. The main goal is to keep
    the user, you, laughing, and to hopefully inspire you to become creative in creating your own Mad Libs. We also encourage you to go to our "Tutorial" and to learn how each question should be answer.
    It will also tell you how many answers you can have, and what to place into some answer boxes! We thank you for coming and visiting our site. Please feel free to email us at <i><b>contact-us@BrainInsaneInc.com</b></i>.
