            A man is given a <b>"<div id="Scenario1"></div>"</b> as a weapon. The reason why he has this weapon is to defend himself from the dangers of evil. The evil is what keeps people like him, in dire need to defend himself with their
            treacherous vile ways against his kind. The <b>"<div id="Scenario2"></div>"</b> is the worst kind of creature to run into out in this world. It has identifying features that are <b>"<div id="Scenario3"></div>"</b> and are deadly.
            There are only <b>"<div id="Scenario4"></div>"</b> survivors including himself. They call their leader, the man, the name that frightens all other creatures <b>"<div id="Scenario5"></div><div id="Scenario6"></div>"</b>.
            However, once upon a time back some ten years ago, they ran into a supply block, and the survivors were in need of aid. The <b>"<div id="Scenario7"></div><div id="Scenario8"></div>"</b> leader, decided to run into the back way of an utility
            building. However, he was being chased by the <b>"<div id="Scenario9"></div>"</b> and for him to enter the building he had to press a button on a control panel. But wait! There was not one button on the panel but multiple buttons!
            He continued and took a large chance and pressed the <b>"<div id="Scenario10"></div>"</b>. Luck was on his side, and the door's locks were released and he was able to get into safety and lock the door behind him. Once inside he found
            that he actually ran into the hive of those vile creatures!. He used his <b>"<div id="Scenario11"></div>"</b> to decimate those creatures standing in his path to the aid he needed for his group of survivors! He reached the final destination where
            the supplies were sitting in multiple crates. He was wondering how in the world he was going to get all of those crates outside, and escape those creatures waiting for him on the other side of those doors. He then thought of a magnificent plan.
            He cooked up some <b>"<div id="Scenario12"></div>"</b> and opened the doors and the <b>"<div id="Scenario13"></div>"</b> smelled the food and ran over and grabbed some and started eating, ignoring him and the supplies. The leader took the
            opportunity and took the supplies and ran all the way back to their campsite. They all celebrated with joy that he returned back in peace, and with his trusty <b>"<div id="Scenario14"></div>"</b>.
