    <tr><td>The night when you went out into the woods. It was a very dark and dreary night, with the cold piercing the skin on your body. You happen to find a book of knowledge about these haunted woods, and you start to read it
        while you are walking down the dark, dirt trail. It says...There have been sightings of <b>"<div id="Short1"></div>"</b> within these woods.
    It is said that there are a group of them, about <b>"<div id="Short2"></div>"</b>. They say they tear into people when they are walking through the woods, so if I were you, I would hurry up. Do not mind the trails of the <b>"<div id="Short3">
            </div>"</b> blood. Once you pass through the gates of the woods, there is no turning back, but it seems like that blood is getting to you now, is it not? Just keep walking down the dirt trail path, with shrubbery coming
    out onto the path, and trees overhanging with creepy vines hanging as low to your feet. You heard a noise. No, could it be? Could it be the pack of <b>"<div id="Short4"></div>"</b>? If I were you I would keep running AWAY from the sounds, don't
    you dare run towards it! It is said to never look backwards once on the trail. The <b>"<div id="Short5"></div>"</b> might be right behind you, stalking you through the night like the grim reaper waiting for the right moment. You hesitate and you run
    right into one them! You suddenly wake up from your dream and then the sigh of relief came over you. You get up and went to the bathroom and looked into the mirror and you scream, as you were, indeed one of the <b>"<div id="Short6">
            </div>"</b>.
